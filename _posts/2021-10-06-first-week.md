# So then.. final year

After facing major burnout throughout the summer, I was excited to come back to university for the final year of my course.

The first week has been quite fun so far, we've all recieved the briefs for our first semester and surprisingly enough, there were 4 different tech art briefs that I got to choose 2 from. I say surprisingly because I know not many people want to specialise in that area (as far as I'm aware I'm the only one), so it was really nice seeing that it was still included. 

After thoroughly reading through all of them, I decided I wanted to do the Shader Museum brief (pretty self explanatory, just a nice way of presenting shader assets that I created) and the LOD tool brief. Now, the latter is way out of my comfort zone, but I decided I want to challenge myself this year and try doing something new. 

For the LOD tool I decided I'm going to write it all in Python, a programming language that I have a little bit of experience in after finishing my personal summer project [Curby](https://github.com/anukiancu/curby), a discord bot. Even so, I'm looking forward to working with the Unreal Engine API and learning more about how it works.

On a separate note, now that I've finally set up my own professional blog, I'll keep updating it with progress on both projects, as I'm sure it'll be quite the ride!

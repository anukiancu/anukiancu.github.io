# A python newbie's approach

## Why I chose the project

Going into this project was a bit of a leap of faith. Faith that I'll be able to pick up a new programming language and use it with the Unreal Enginge Python API to create a tool according to the project brief.

 All in all, I'm more than willing to put in all the effort it will take to teach myself this stuff now, as I know it will be really helpful knowledge to have before going into the industry. I had a quick chat with someone the other day, and they said something among the lines of "If you're a good technical artist, I can basically guarantee you a job". Needless to say, that really motivated me.


 ## Setup

Due to the restrictions university enforced on all campus computers, I ran into a million issues while setting up for the project. Tech support was amazing and stayed by my side during what should've been a straight-forward process (installing git, Visual Studio Code, poetry etc.), but ended up taking such a long time and a lot of brain power for troubleshooting. 

It's all working now though, and I ***really*** hope I won't need to ask for more help, because I'm sure every time Craig from IT sees my purple hair he wants to run away.

## Getting the script to run in UE4

I wasn't exactly aware that you need to enable some extra pluggins in Unreal to be able to run Python scripts, but we live and we learn.

# One Month In 
And two projects down. I'd lie if I said I wasn't very happy with my speed this year. I have to admit, part of it was due to fear of not making my deadline (especially on my LOD tool project), and that really drove me to push myself and learn a lot of new things really fast. I feel really lucky to now be able to focus entirely on personal projects and making a career, however the thought of starting on my final major project early has crossed my mind a few times.

# Last few bits and bobs
I can now finally say that I'm happy with the way the Shader Museum looks (considering it's not an environment art project). I've added a directional light under the ground to create some cool shadows, tweaked the colour of the igloo's walls a little bit and vois-la:

I'll also quickly include a couple of videos of each shader.

# Final Thoughts
Overall, I think that if I were to tackle another project of this sort in the future, I would start by making a moodboard and setting a theme for the environment rather than just jumping straight into the Material Editor. I was lucky enough to be able to make everything work with each other as I went, but I think having a set theme from the get go is definitely the way to go. Other than that, I'm happy with my time management and the order I did the rest of the things in, from making the first shader to making the footprints and bringing the igloo in.

### That's it for this project. Do check back soon though, as I will be showing off some of my personal projects in the near future! Thanks for reading!

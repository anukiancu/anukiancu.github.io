# Making an UI in Unreal Engine 4 is really easy
Making a good looking UI however.. not so much. The first limitation of the `Editor Utility Widget Blueprint` is that you need to break your code into little snippets in order to assign it to buttons. That gave me a little headache to begin with, but at the end of the day I had both the code  **and** the UI ready. 

Now, I'm not saying this is the best looking UI on planet Earth, not even close. It's just there to ensure the tool works as intended for now. Eventually I will give it a prettier face too, but as for right now, have a look.

I still need to figure our how exactly to get the window to be the right size when you open it, but that's a job for tomorrow me. Tonight me will take a little break and relax with a cup of peach and orange tea (if you haven't tried it yet, this is your sign - you will not regret it).

That's all for this little update. See you in the next post!

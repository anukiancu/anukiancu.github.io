# Wait, an Environment Art Project?
Well, yes.. and no. Although this project started as an environment art project last summer, I decided to take it in another direction now. 

The original idea was really simple - make a 1950's inspired diner environment, and perhaps experiment a bit with blueprints while at it. Now, it's the other way around. I won't focus as much on asset creation, and move my attention more towards lighting and making the level as interactive as possible. 

# Speaking of lighting
I've played around a bit with the setting of the diner, especially the lights. Here's a comparison between it during the day and night.

As of right now, I think I prefer the night setting a bit more, but that's just because I'm more used to creating night environments, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to try something new.

# Ok but where's the tech?
Fear not, there's plenty of techy stuff already in this level, and I plan to add much more. The main thing I want to show right now is my jukebox that actually plays music.

I also made a minimap (WIP) and I plan on making a coke vending machine/fridge of sorts soon.

### Stay tuned for more updates on this project. See you soon!
